description: Create a raycast script
---

Look at the code of @raycast to understand how the raycast script works.

- @raycast/save-current-clipboard.sh
- @raycast/run-upload-image.sh

If needed complexe logique or library, you can use a TypeScript script that will be run by the raycast script.

In the folder @bun you can find some.

When creating a script in @bun, please create a folder with a TypeScript file for example @bun/upload-files-to-r2/upload-to-r2-path.ts
