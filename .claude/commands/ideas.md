# Ideas Entry Manager

This command is for creating, updated and finding ideas. Each entry is stored in a markdown file inside @ideas folder.

## Usage:

- `/journal` - Create an new idea. When we create idea, you should create a file with the right idea name.
- `/journal edit idea-name some-content` - Add some content to an existing idea. `idea-name` does NOT need to exactly match the name of the file, just find the most related file or create it.
