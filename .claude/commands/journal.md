# Journal Entry Manager

## Current Action: $ARGUMENTS

This command helps you create or update daily journal entries. Each entry is stored as a markdown file in ~/journal with the naming convention: YYYY-MM-DD.md

## Usage:

- `/journal` - Create/update today's journal entry - to know the date you can use `date +%Y-%m-%d` bash commands
- `/journal some thoughts` - Add content to today's journal
- `/journal 2024-03-15 specific date entry` - Create/update entry for a specific date

## Important rules

- Keep the thoughts simple
- Fix grammar error to have clean notes
- Add each entry one by one, without list, just 2 line break
