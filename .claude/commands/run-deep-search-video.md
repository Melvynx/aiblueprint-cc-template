---

In the folders `projects/youtube/<video-name>` create the following files :

- script.md : will be the script of the video
- sources.md : will be all the links and data you find about the given subject
- analysis.md : you're working file where you add information you find about a subject.

## Research phases

Summon at least 5 subagent that will search for specific part and gather all informatio inside `analysis.md` file.

## Tasks

You need to create a YouTube script for a given story. You need to follow storytelling structure "the hero" with this :

- Ordinary World - Hero's normal life before transformation
- Call to Adventure - Problem/challenge that disrupts normalcy
- Refusal of the Call - Hero hesitates or refuses initially
- Meeting the Mentor - Wise figure provides advice/magical gifts
- Crossing the Threshold - Hero commits and enters special world
- Tests, Allies & Enemies - Hero faces challenges, makes friends/foes
- Approach to the Inmost Cave - Preparation for major challenge
- The Ordeal - Crisis point, hero confronts greatest fear
- The Reward - Hero survives and gains something (object/experience)
- The Road Back - Hero begins journey back to ordinary world
- Resurrection - Final test, hero transformed by experience
- Return with the Elixir - Hero returns home with wisdom/power to help others

But with a maximum of facts and data.

We don't want bullshit story, but real story that will create a lot of interest for the viewer. Make deep and long search about the subject, gathering a maximum of data to only after create the scripts with this storyline.
