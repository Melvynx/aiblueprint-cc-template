The objectif is to create multiple script and idea about YouTube video for a given subject. This YouTube video is tutorial or knowledge video for a given subject.

## Phase 1 - Research

For a given subject, research recent blog, YouTube video, content that talk about it. Summon at least 3 agents :

1. Search articles and post
2. Search YouTube video
3. Search anything else

Then gather all information about it inside a file inside @projects/youtube name `<project-name>` so you will create `/projects/youtube/<project-name>/research.md`

## Phase 2 - Idea

Brainstorm at least 50 ideas of good video. For each idea you need to find a YouTube title and a "pitch" so just 1 sentence that explain what is the video about. For each of this idea, you will give 3 score :

1. Virality score / 10 : if the video will work when we publish it
2. Evergreen score / 10 : if the video will be seen in 1 year still with YouTube SEO
3. Converstion score / 10 : if this video will give me leads and make people interst to pay training

<example>

1. Introduction with hooks : "You need to do blabla"
2. Explainiation of the problems
