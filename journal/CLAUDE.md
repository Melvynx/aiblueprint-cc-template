# Journal System - Claude Instructions

## What is Journaling in Personal Development?

Journaling is a powerful tool for self-expression, personal growth, and mental clarity. It's more than just documenting daily lifeâ€”it's a structured approach to processing emotions, setting goals, and developing self-awareness.

### Core Benefits
- **Mental Health**: Reduces stress, anxiety, and helps process difficult emotions
- **Personal Growth**: Increases self-awareness, clarity, and emotional intelligence  
- **Goal Achievement**: Helps break down goals, track progress, and maintain accountability
- **Creativity**: Sparks new ideas and solutions through free expression
- **Memory**: Sharpens memory and awareness of patterns in your life

### Common Journaling Methods
- **Free Writing**: Stream of consciousness without structure or judgment
- **Gratitude Journaling**: Daily appreciation practice for improved mood
- **Reflection**: End-of-day/week analysis of experiences and lessons
- **Goal Setting**: Planning and tracking personal objectives
- **Morning Pages**: Three pages of unstructured writing to start the day

## Purpose of Our System

The journal folder is used to define all the things we want to do and all the small notes we take. We must always follow exactly the same format to maintain consistency and readability.

## Standard Format

Using the `@.claude/commands/journal.md` command, you can see the standard format:

```
# Journal YYYY-MM-DD

Entry 1

Entry 2

Entry 3
```

## Formatting Rules

- **Repeat this standard format** with each idea separated by **two line breaks**
- **Format user ideas** without changing the content too much
- **Keep the raw content** but modify a few things to make it cleaner and more readable
- **Goal**: have a readable, clear and precise journal with ideas

## Style Guidelines

- Don't hesitate to add **more line breaks**
- Use **lists** when appropriate
- Add **bold** for emphasis
- Use **very light markdown formatting**
- Keep a **close and natural** style

## Process

1. Take the user's raw ideas
2. Clean them slightly (grammar, clarity)
3. Format them according to the standard template
4. Separate each idea with two line breaks
5. Add minimal markdown formatting for readability
