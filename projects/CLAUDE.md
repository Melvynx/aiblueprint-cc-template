Each project is represented by a folder. For example:

`/projects/saveit-now` is for the project "SaveIt.now". Inside this folder, you can have many different files, such as assets and documents.

The main file of each project is `About.me`, which includes all the information about the project for a quick understanding.

## How to name files

Name each file starting with an uppercase letter and use spaces:

<bad-names>

- `about.md`
- `Marketing_strategy.md`
- `content.md`

</bad-names>

<good-names>

- `About.md`
- `Marketing Strategy.md`
- `Content.md`

</good-names>
